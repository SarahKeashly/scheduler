# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a React application that allows users to book and cancel interviews. We combine a concise API with a WebSocket servier to build a realtime experience.

During this Lighthouse Labs project, we learned how to work with React while using Storybook, Jest, and Cypress to test the functionality of this single page application.

I really enjoyed working with setting state and hooks, while handling multiple components.
